Scenario- Alpine Inc. hired me as a Dev Ops practitioner in this case. Pete, Alpine's lead developer, had just taken a leave of absence, and Alpine had missed a critical launch including a new feature for an important customer. The issue is that this newly released version has experienced quite a number of flaws that are having a major effect on the company's internal and external stakeholders. 

Solution- DevOps practitioners must create and implement a continuous integration pipeline that will automatically run the tests and construct the necessary infrastructure to fix the problem. The automated test will immediately discover and notify the bug to the development team so that it may be debugged before any modifications are accepted for production.
